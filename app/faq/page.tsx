      {
        id: 'what-is',
        question: 'What is the AI Beauty Test?',
        answer: 'The AI Beauty Test is an advanced facial analysis tool that uses artificial intelligence to analyze your facial features and provide an objective attractiveness score on a scale from 1 to 10. The test evaluates factors such as facial symmetry, proportions, feature harmony, and adherence to beauty standards derived from scientific research on human perception of attractiveness.'
      },
      {
        id: 'how-works',
        question: 'How does the AI Beauty Test work?',
        answer: 'Our AI uses deep learning algorithms trained on thousands of facial images to analyze your photo. When you upload a photo, our system identifies key facial landmarks, measures facial symmetry, evaluates proportions against the golden ratio, assesses feature harmony, and analyzes skin quality. These factors are combined using our proprietary algorithm to calculate your overall beauty score.'
      },
      {
        id: 'accurate',
        question: 'How accurate is the AI Beauty Test?',
        answer: 'While beauty is ultimately subjective, our AI provides a consistent objective analysis based on widely recognized beauty standards. Our system has been calibrated by comparing its results with human panel ratings, achieving a correlation of approximately 85-90%. However, remember that the score reflects only mathematical aspects of facial structure and doesn\'t account for personality, charisma, or individual preferences.'
      },
      {
        id: 'how-normal',
        question: 'What is the "How Normal Am I" test?',
        answer: 'The "How Normal Am I" test is a variation of our facial analysis technology that measures how closely your facial features match statistical averages rather than beauty standards. This test can reveal whether your face has common or unique characteristics compared to the general population. It\'s a fun way to discover how distinctive your facial features are.'
      },
      {
        id: 'beauty-score',
        question: 'What does my beauty score mean?',
        answer: 'Your beauty score is a numerical rating from 1 to 10 that represents how closely your facial features align with classical beauty standards based on symmetry, proportions, and harmony. A higher score indicates stronger alignment with these standards. For a detailed explanation of score ranges, visit our Beauty Score Explained page.'
      },
      {
        id: 'improve-score',
        question: 'Can I improve my beauty score?',
        answer: 'Yes! Along with your score, we provide personalized recommendations for enhancing your appearance based on your specific facial features. These might include tips about flattering hairstyles, optimal photo angles, skincare suggestions, or makeup techniques that can highlight your best features. Additionally, better photo quality, lighting, and angle can significantly improve your score.'
      }
    ],
    technical: [
      {
        id: 'photo-requirements',
        question: 'What type of photo should I upload?',
        answer: 'For best results, upload a clear, front-facing photo with good lighting and a neutral expression. Your face should be fully visible with no obstructions like sunglasses, masks, or heavy makeup effects. Avoid using photos with filters or heavy editing. The photo should be in color (not black and white) and show your face from forehead to chin.'
      },
      {
        id: 'multiple-faces',
        question: 'What happens if there are multiple people in my photo?',
        answer: 'Our AI will attempt to identify the most prominent face in the image. However, for the most accurate results, we recommend uploading a photo where you are the only person visible. Group photos may lead to incorrect analysis or errors in face detection.'
      },
      {
        id: 'device-compatibility',
        question: 'Which devices and browsers support the AI Beauty Test?',
        answer: 'Our AI Beauty Test works on all modern devices including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. We support all major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The test is fully responsive and optimized for both touchscreen and mouse/keyboard inputs.'
      },
      {
        id: 'errors',
        question: 'I\'m getting an error when trying to upload my photo. What should I do?',
        answer: 'Common issues include uploading files that are too large or in unsupported formats. Make sure your image is under 10MB and in JPG, PNG, or WebP format. If you\'re still experiencing problems, try using a different browser, clearing your cache, or using a different device. If problems persist, please contact our support team.'
      },
      {
        id: 'technology',
        question: 'What technology powers the AI Beauty Analyzer?',
        answer: 'Our system uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and advanced computer vision techniques. The technology stack includes TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning, custom-trained facial landmark detection models, and proprietary algorithms for beauty analysis. For more technical details, visit our AI Beauty Analyzer page.'
      }
    ],
    results: [
      {
        id: 'different-scores',
        question: 'Why do I get different scores with different photos?',
        answer: 'Your score can vary between photos due to several factors: lighting conditions, camera angle, facial expression, image quality, and styling elements like makeup or hairstyle. This actually demonstrates the tool\'s sensitivity to these factors and can help you understand which aspects of your presentation are most flattering.'
      },
      {
        id: 'traits-meaning',
        question: 'What do the different facial traits in my results mean?',
        answer: 'Each trait in your results represents a specific aspect of facial attractiveness. For example, "Symmetry" measures how balanced the left and right sides of your face are, "Harmony" assesses how well your features work together, and "Golden Ratio" evaluates how closely your facial proportions match classical beauty standards. Each trait contributes to your overall score in varying degrees.'
      },
      {
        id: 'disagree-results',
        question: 'I disagree with my score. Why might this happen?',
        answer: 'While our AI strives for objectivity, beauty remains partially subjective. Your score might differ from your self-perception or others\' opinions for several reasons: the photo quality might not be optimal, beauty standards vary across cultures and individuals, and our AI focuses on facial structure rather than personality, expressiveness, or charismaâ€”all of which contribute to real-world attractiveness.'
      },
      {
        id: 'celebrities-score',
        question: 'How do celebrities score on the beauty test?',
        answer: 'While we don\'t publish celebrity scores without permission, our internal testing shows that most celebrities considered conventionally attractive typically score between 7.5-9.5. However, even among celebrities, scores can vary significantly based on the specific photo used. Remember that celebrities benefit from professional photography, lighting, makeup, and sometimes digital enhancement.'
      },
      {
        id: 'age-factor',
        question: 'Does age affect my beauty score?',
        answer: 'Our AI has been trained on diverse datasets including faces of various ages, and it evaluates facial features rather than age itself. However, certain age-related factors like skin texture and facial volume can influence specific trait scores. We strive to provide fair analysis across all age groups, focusing on the harmony and balance of your unique facial features regardless of age.'
      }
    ],
    privacy: [
      {
        id: 'photo-storage',
        question: 'Are my photos stored after analysis?',
        answer: 'No. We prioritize your privacy and do not permanently store your photos. When you upload a photo, it is processed in real-time on our secure servers, and the image data is automatically deleted once the analysis is complete (typically within seconds). We never share your photos with third parties.'
      },
      {
        id: 'data-collection',
        question: 'What data do you collect during the beauty test?',
        answer: 'We collect minimal data needed to provide our service: temporary image data during processing (deleted afterward), your beauty score and feature analysis (not linked to personal identity), and standard usage metrics like device type and browser. We do not require personal information such as names or email addresses to use the basic test.'
      },
      {
        id: 'data-sharing',
        question: 'Do you share my results or data with third parties?',
        answer: 'No. Your beauty test results remain private and are not shared with third parties. We may use aggregated, anonymized data for research and service improvement, but this never includes personally identifiable information or individual photos.'
      },
      {
        id: 'security-measures',
        question: 'What security measures do you have in place?',
        answer: 'We implement industry-standard security measures including: end-to-end encryption for data transfer, secure cloud servers with restricted access, automated deletion of image data after processing, regular security audits, and compliance with data protection regulations. Our system is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle.'
      },
      {
        id: 'gdpr-compliance',
        question: 'Is the AI Beauty Test GDPR compliant?',
        answer: 'Yes. Our service is designed to be compliant with GDPR and other privacy regulations. We process minimal data, maintain transparency about our practices, obtain appropriate consent, securely process data, and respect user rights regarding their personal information. For more details, please review our Privacy Policy.'

        id: 'cost',
        question: 'Is the AI Beauty Test free to use?',
        answer: 'Yes, the basic AI Beauty Test is completely free to use. You can upload your photo and receive your beauty score and basic analysis at no cost. We also offer premium features for users who want more detailed analysis, personalized recommendations, or additional tests.'
      },
      {
        id: 'limitations',
        question: 'Are there any limitations on using the test?',
        answer: 'The free version has some limitations: you can analyze a limited number of photos per day, and certain detailed analysis features are reserved for premium users. Additionally, we require users to be 18 years or older, and the service should not be used to analyze photos of minors.'
      },
      {
        id: 'compare-results',
        question: 'Can I compare my results with friends or others?',
        answer: 'Yes! You can share your results with friends through our integrated social sharing options. This can be a fun way to compare scores and insights. Many users enjoy challenging friends to take the test and comparing their results. Remember that beauty is subjective, and our AI provides just one perspective.'
      },
      {
        id: 'save-results',
        question: 'Can I save my results for later?',
        answer: 'By default, your results are temporary and will not be saved after you leave the site. However, you can download your results as an image to save locally, or you can create an account to save your history and track changes over time with different photos.'
      },
      {
        id: 'premium-features',
        question: 'What additional features do premium users get?',
        answer: 'Premium users enjoy several benefits: unlimited photo analysis, detailed facial feature reports, personalized enhancement recommendations, historical result tracking, comparison tools to test different looks, and access to exclusive tests and features. Premium subscriptions help support our ongoing development.'
