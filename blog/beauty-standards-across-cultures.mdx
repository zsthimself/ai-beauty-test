When using our AI Beauty Test tool, you might wonder: Are there truly universal standards of beauty? How do people from different cultural backgrounds define facial attractiveness? This article will take you on a global journey to explore beauty standards across different cultures and how these differences affect AI beauty scoring.

## Universality and Diversity of Beauty
